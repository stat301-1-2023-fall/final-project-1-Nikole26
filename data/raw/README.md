## Datasets

This dataset was acquired through scraping TripAdvisor (TA), a well-known travel website, for its restaurant information. The dataset contains a pool of restaurants across European countries. The raw datasets for Europe's largest cities were carefully selected and combined for further examination. Thus, this dataset contains 1,083,397 observations and 42 variables. Among these variables, 25 are categorical and 17 are numericals. 

This dataset is credited to Stefano Leone on Kaggle, a platform dedicated to data science.
